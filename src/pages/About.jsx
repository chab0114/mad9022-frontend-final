                HolyCrapr is a platform for people to get rid of unwanted items from their homes. 
                Instead of throwing things away, find someone who might want them!
                </p>
                <p>
                Our mission is to reduce waste and build community connections through the sharing of resources.
                One person's unwanted item could be exactly what someone else is looking for.
                </p>
                <p>
                Browse available items, offer your own unwanted things, and help create a more sustainable future.
